# ProsemirrorRtea

**_UNPUBLISHED!_**
This repo is still in the exploritory phase of development, and everything is subject to change while I figure out how I want/need all this to work.

Prosemirror-rtea is an Angular rich text editor application based off of the Prosemirror editor, and contains a variaty of angular component views with companion Prosemirror plugins to drive them.

Prosemirror-rtea-extentions contains additional non-angular viewless prosemirror plugins and plugin bases.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.8.

## Demo

To run the demo, run `npm i` at the project root, and then `npm run start` to start the demo application.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
